# CROWDWORK: DAO Global Hackathon Submission

## Short Pitch

### Pain

We believe Dao’s are only scratching the surface of a global shift into teamwork. In order to support this growing movement. As DAOs evolve, the complexity of both qualifications and specialization of work will increase, while standardization will decrease, creating a unique problem. More jobs will be created specifically to suit the needs of each DAO, but DAOs are left without a strong system to support the fulfillment of those needs. Crowdwork streamlines the onboarding and engagement process for DAO contributors.

- Unstandardized Job Requirements → Preset Qualifiers
- Long Job Descriptions → Preset Services, Capped Descriptions.
- Individual Oriented Platform → Collaborative Platform
- Lengthy Employment Contracts → Sprint Based Work
- Written Job Proposals → 1-Click Proposals

### Target audience

Remote workers, DAOs.

### Solution

Crowdwork is a blockchain based team building tool for DAO’s to internally source work using preselected qualifiers to create a quantified platform. With attention at a premium, a framework that cuts through the ‘noise’ through restrictive design will drive greater efficiency, predictive capabilities, and an overall improvement in user experience.

- Preset Qualifiers → Blockchain Based Immutable Qualification
- Restrictive Descriptions → Less Market Noise, Better Quality Data
- Preselected Services → Creates a Market, Allows For a Fair Price Estimate.
- Collaborative platform → More Human Centric, Socially Conscious
- 1-Click Proposals → More work, less writing.
